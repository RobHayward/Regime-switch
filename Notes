This is a file to practice the TiKz package.  Much of this comes from the minimal introduction to TiZk (in ``other'' folder).

has an excellent overview of markov HMM and the R code necessary. One component of this that could be of interest is the assertion in on-line bimetrixs text that it is a problem to find the underlying state that produced the DNA outcome.  The equivalent of this for the crash model is to find the underlying Minsky state that produced the market activity. 

This is the folder for builing the regime-switching model. The three latent states are the periods of shock, of calm and of crisis.  These are unseen but may be identified by other variables (such as the level of international risk aversion (VIX) or the state of domestic political uncertainty (see that buy at Yale???)).  Alternatively, it may be possible to draw the states from the data and compare the information that is supplied by the data with that from what is known about politicla and economic developments at the time.  It is also possible to assess the probability that there will be a switch from one regime to another.  This is a Markov-swithing model. 

The motivation for this research is to help to identify regimes and therefore help authorities determine the risk of financial crisis or crash. Use the FX market to get a broader understanding of some of the forces at work.
