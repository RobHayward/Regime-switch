Notes
========================================================
These are from Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model](Mixture Model).  Probabilistic model where there are subpopulations. This is based on a mixture distribution. There are N random variables that relate to a distribution with K components. The mixture weights sum to one. There are K sets of parameters specificying the distribution (such as mean and variance for a normal distribution). The mixture weights are the same as the *factor loadings* (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis](Wikipdeia on factor analysis) ).  There may be something in that to answer the question about how many regimes to choose. 

These are some notes from the Economic Systems Journal [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09393625/38/1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09393625/38/1)

This is a symbosium on challenges to financial stability in central and eastern Europe. There is focus on the importance of credit growth. The importance of foreign currency loans was central to CEE. Fidrmuc, Crespo Cuaresma and Hake analyse 21 studies and find that supply factors are the most important.

Egert and Kocenda show how the exchange rate affects capital flows.  GARCH model shows that exchange rates of CEE are sensitive to macroeconomic news. Crisis influences the currencies.  They react more to the central bank in the crisis.
