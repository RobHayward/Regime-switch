The Brunnermeier, Nagel and Pedersen (2013) present the carry trade hypothesis. The forward premium puzzle is what appears to make the carry trade profitable.  

This paper finds that the Yen, Swiss franc and US dollar are safe haven and that this status does change over time. Sterling was a safe haven for a while and the Singapore dollar has become more of a haven over time. 

Engel has a follow-up to the Hodrick survey of the UIP literature from 1987.  The change in the future exchange rate is usually negatively related to the forward discount. Engel summarises the evidence as test reject the idea that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate; risk premium models have not been successful in explaining the apparent bias. 


There is some suggestion that peson problems, learning and irrational speculation can help to understand. This study is limited to modesl of rational expectations and a risk premium. 

The forward bias puzzle rests on the empirical evidence that a regression of the forward rate on the future exchange rate is less than one and usually less than zero.  This implies two things
