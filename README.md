# Regime-switch
This is the folder for the regime-switching model
The paper is developed over time.  
The main documents are in Notes.  There is the original Humgarian paper (Notes), there is the update for the BBS conference 
(RIskMOdel).  This puts the emphasis on the risk model.
I think that this now needs to be simplified. 
There are probably three papers here: 

1 The introduction to the use of this model as a method
2 THe use of the model to compare the effect of risk aversion, interest rates and bankig condidtions on vlunerability
3 The use of the model as a real-time risk managemnt tool
