# Regime-switch
This is the folder for the regime-switching model

One additional model that may be included would be a dummy for ViX above a certain level.  Possibly a threashold model. 

Now working on the Package_preparation folder in R.files.  Compare_Mod.R is the attempt to compare Log Likelihood ratios.  This is the baseic analysis (some discusison of the Log-likelihood ratio).  Then some testing of the process (real time test of Financial Crisis and other events).  

End with a composite index. 

The paper is developed over time.  
The main documents are in Notes.  There is the original Hungarian paper (Notes), there is the update for the BBS conference 
(Risk Model).  This puts the emphasis on the risk 

There are probably three papers here: 

1 The introduction to the use of this model as a method.  This is the FirstPaper folder. 

2 The use of the model to compare the effect of risk aversion, interest rates and banking conditions on vulnerability

3 The use of the model as a real-time risk management tool
