1) The data are downloaded from the IMF database using the Getdata.R file. BalkLend.R file is very similar.  
2) First run the LoadData.R file.
3) FW.R will create the function forp to calculate the forward and probability
4) forp requres fx b and m for finance currency, base currency and maturity respectively. These can be found in da.  
5) forp outputs a list g comprised of daz (the data), fx, b, M, and the profit from a carry investment. 
6) Compare_Mod.R will create the table of AIC and log-likelihood ratios.  Not complete. 
7) CrisisProb.R will assess the probability of a crisis on a specific date. There is an error.  The idea is that it takes data to a particular point and claculates the probability of crisis at that date.
