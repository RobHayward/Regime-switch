1) The data are downloaded from the IMF database using the Getdata.R file. BalkLend.R file is very similar.  
2) First run the LoadData.R file.
3) FW.R will create the function forp to calculate the forward and probability
4) forp requres fx b and m for finance currency, base currency and maturity respectively. These can be found in da.  
5) forp outputs a list g comprised of daz (the data), fx, b, M, and the profit from a carry investment. 
6) Compare_Mod.R will create the table of AIC and log-likelihood ratios.  This can be completed funding currency at a time (using i = xxx) as the Albanian three-regime model did not work.  
6.1) Compare_Mod2.R will compare modesl with the conditional transition.  Albania and Greece are compared to 2 regime-transition and the others are compared to the 3-regime transition.  Only VIX is used.  Seems that interest rates are wrong way round. 
6.5) Now try to create the table of regime probabilities.  These are under construction in Copyof3StageFundTab.R  The two should be easy as there are only 2 countries. The three stage table is createed in the file called CopyOf3StageFundTab.R and the results are in M3S.csv.  

6.6) Now need to look at the way that VIX rates and Ted affect the transiaton probabilities. This has been set up in TransProb3s.R  Not sure that the loop works but I think that the key components do.  

6.7) Now create the probabilities given exogenous with TransPlot.R

7) CrisisProb.R will assess the probability of a crisis on a specific date. There is an error.  The idea is that it takes data to a particular point and claculates the probability of crisis at that date. I will not use this but I may return at a later date. 
8) Now I need to get the probabilities as ViX changes.  This is a new model and we need to extract the probability of switching from calm to crisis as VIX moves from mean level to plus and minus its standard deviation. 
Crisis.Prob does work. It will give the probability of crisis at a particular point. It can be used to estimate a probability of crisis at each point in time.
