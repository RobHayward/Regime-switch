Note
Use prepare2.R first. This contains the functions to download the data and the function forp to calculate the forward profits given the funding currency, investment currency and the time.  

Use Raw.R to carry out the HMM analysis. It will also add a column of 1s for the USD.  This is an example of what can be done. 

"table2"" is a table of two-stage return parameters for one funding currency when used with Test2State.R and delivers each funding currency into the "funding" vector when used with "2StageFundTab.R" 

2StteProp.R will calculate the probbility of being in each state, add these probabilities and the dates tht the system is in each regime to the list2 and will cocatonate the dates into a list for all the crash regimes (assessed by the states with the lowest returns). 

The 3StageFundTab.R will loop through funding currencies to calculate profits against each of the investment currencies.  The EEK and LVL do not work.  The RUB does not work against the CHF.  

Trans.R will create tables of the regime parameters and transition matrix parameters. 
 

Raw.R will create the estimates and the graphs if the funding and investment currencies are changed. There are no inputs as yet. 
-----------------------
Test2state.R will loop through funding currencies to produce tables and graphs for 2 regimes. 

the "funding"" list collects the profits from the regimes. 
list4 is a list of each of the funding currencies with the parameters, Loglikelihood, posterior states and probabilities. There is also a zoo profit series for charting.  

****Now want to extract the parameters of the transition matrix****
This is done in trans.R

2StageFundTab.R create the table in Notes.tex for the two regimes that are analysed. 

Use getpars(fm2) to get parameters
table has the parameters in order (state 1, state 2 etc)
table2 has calm and crisis. 
list has a list of the calm and crisis returns
list2 has parameters and Loglikelihood

Use slot.names(???) to get the slots for an S4 object.

Depmix is the vignette.

Chapter10.R and viterbi.R cover the alogos

Raw(test).R has some experiments.
