Note
Use prepare2.R first. This contains the functions to download the data and the function forp to calculate the forward profits given the funding currency, investment currency and the time.  
Use Raw.R to carry out the HMM analysis. It will also add a column of 1s for the USD. 

Raw.R will create the estimates and the graphs if the funding and investment currencies are changed. There are no inputs as yet. 
-----------------------
Test2state.R will loop through funding currencies to produce tables and graphs for 2 regimes. 

Use getpars(fm2) to get parameters
table has the parameters in order (state 1, state 2 etc)
table2 has calm and crisis. 
list has a list of the calm and crisis returns
list2 has parameters and Loglikelihood

Use slot.names(???) to get the slots for an S4 object.
